# sampleExpressApp

1. Run run database in localhost
2. In console type: DEBUG=myapp:* npm start
3. Type http://localhost:3000/ in browser. 

I use JadeTemplate as view engine. I route requests in app.js. I do not validate fields, so this app is vulnerable on SQL injection. I know that code suck, but I had to write fast something on school project. Hope you enjoy this app.
